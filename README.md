Assignment by Paulo Tam
Submitted 22 June 2016

The Assignment can be described in 3 StoryBoards.

StoryBoard 1
------------


Splash Screen. Can use this screen to show a start button and a nice graphic to
start before the app opens up.


StoryBoard 2
------------

The Camera screen which picks up the face and overlays the face onto the person.
A collection View to give the user options of faces to play with.

StoryBoard 3
------------

The Preview Screen, which a share button, which allows the sharing to facebook
or Twitter.


Talking Points
--------------

Collection View, Delegates
Passing image via VC and perform Segue
AVCaptureVideo
CIImages, CIFaceFeature
GLKView
Unwind - instead of Navigation Controller
Activity Center to share


Immediate Steps
---------------

Fix programming patterns.
In certain spots have have force unwrapped items to prevent other parts of the
code complaining. This is important to do before release.


Future Steps
------------

The first screen was a splash screen to allow the user to download images and data from
the server to support the function of the app. But due to the limitation of time
it was left out as the more important part was to show the overlay on the face
and the share capability.

Zooming on the face?

Get more faces into the App!

Currently I have two faces into the app to play with with the intent to extend
to four, and even to 18 for all AFL teams, but it was more important to get the
app working first before doing photoshop type elements into the app.
